# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

##Completed by Darshan Panesar
##Note: Extension given for assignment submission by module instructor for Friday May 2, 2025 due to illness. 

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like!
 
- Good Chart: Call Center Monthly Repeat Call Rate - Lowest/Highest
-     Data Source: From https://datavizproject.com/data-type/column-range/ Ocala 2014; https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/75/42/81/754281989bb1a12c91e485e456d99616.jpg
-     Data Type: This is quantitative data (percentages), that is collected across time, there is probably more data than presented in the graph
-     Input Type: 1 x variable  which has 2 corresponding Y (y1 and y2) on the same x axis
-     Brief Description: the graph summarizes the highest and lowest per month repeat call percentage.
-     Visualization type: column range chart (chart family), function is a comparison, and the shape are simple horizontal bars

- Bad Chart: I have a headache Visualization
-     Data Source: From https://datavizproject.com/data-type/bubble-chart/ by Help Remedies, Designed by Sophie a data visualization specialist http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665355/infographic-of-the-day-the-insane-choices-you-face-at-the-drugstore
-     Data Type: This is linked data of different options the consumer has at different levels starting with Ingredients, Brand, Age, Form, Dosage, Price, Quantity, and Symptoms and then expanding into a slew of options. It looks like a mix of categorical, ordinal, quantitative data types.
-     Input Type: Ideally a bubble chart is supposed to present data is a 3 dimensional way. In my example several categories (8+) It takes a data entity and its triplet of associated data (and relationships) and plots it as circles and utilize both location and size to depict the triplet values and relationships.
-     Brief Description: The decision making process of an ordinary American drug consumer with a headache.
-     Visualization type: bubble chart (chart/plot family), function is a comparison, distribution, or trend over time, and the shape(s) are circles. But this looks more along the line of networks and trees with items and links based on choice attributed.

- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
    This is a good example of a data visualization for the following reasons:
  a. The perceived goal of this graph is to inform the viewer the minimum and maximum repeat caller rate per month for this specific call center. It accomplishes this clearly for a couple of reasons. The majority        of the reasons are concepts covered in our second lecture (Choosing the right visualization).
  b. Foremost this chart fulfils several aspects of the encode portion of 'how' a visualization is designed. It uses position of each bar to indicate its position on the x axis for both the corresponding y’s (y1         and y2). It uses colour saturation though not necessary to demonstrate a transition between months (Jan to Dec). The size of each horizontal bar gives the viewer an easy way to identify which sets of min/max        have a small and large range between them. This can allow for some further evaluation. This also falls under good spatial positioning on a common scale which again allows the viewer to distinguish even              without the bonus added values for percentages each set of values. There is also a visual bonus that isn’t distracting the values provided for min and max which not only make interpretation easier but also          allow the user to get the accurate values which speaks to its substantive nature. Overall, this chart seems to not only capture the effectiveness and the expressiveness principles for the aforementioned             reasons it serves a clear purpose while minimizing bias. Lastly it also seems to not induce any significant cognitive load in an almost step-by-step manner. 


    This is a bad example of a data visualization for the following reasons: 
  a. Foremost this chart is not only overwhelming to the viewer but also mentions it was “a painful job” for the data visualization specialist. This highlights the concept in lecture 2 of cognitive load. Not only        is it impossible to read many of the labels they are distracting, and the sheer volume of information makes this visualization unpalatable. The viewer has to read the tiny text at the bottom to get a meager         understanding of what is being visualized
  b. Second, key components which may aid this chart are missing namely, a legend explaining the size and colour relevance.
  c. Referencing levels of action, if it is the authors aim to summarize or if it is to produce the decision pathway they have poorly done so. Nothing is really summarized here, nor does it seems particularly well       organized. Therefore, the viewer cannot make a concrete decision on which information should be derived or why.
  d. The paths and topology seems important but the way it is presented it is almost impossible to make sense of this, therefore possible “targets” of the data for either the view or the designer are lost.
  e. Many of the issues are also part of the encode portion of 'how' a visualization is designed. Position, colour, size/area, length, and more are used. However, given the lack of legend and the inability to            clearly distinguish components results is poor effectiveness and expressiveness thus highlighting significant interference.
  f. Side Note: if it means to communicate that the subject of the decision making process experiences cognitive load then it does accomplish this in a way. However, this may be a viewer bias but this decision           making process seems a bit unrealistic, i.e., it doesn’t seem like most people go through this many things when selecting a medication for a headache. This may reference the context and accuracy of what is          being presented. It also seems not to consider key points like availability  of drugs which seems like an important consideration point.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
    o	Recommendations for the good chart:
      a. For the “good” example the foremost recommendation would be to utilize the colour in a meaningful way. For example, the colour saturation could reflect the distance between the min-max values with darker            for larger gaps and lighter for smaller. This would provide more visual information. 
      b. The y axis also needs a label for Month and a legend would be helpful. 
      c. I am not sure but I feel that the x axis should start at 0 rather than an arbitrary 1.5% or some justification should be provided for the selection of this scale otherwise it may bias the viewer due to              centering of certain months on the chart.
      d. Perhaps providing more source information such as which call center and what year may also provide comprehensive information for the viewer. 


    o	Recommendations for the bad chart:
	    a. Foremost, it may be useful to summarize or condense the presented data in a meaningful way. This would allow the designer to include less or more precise information.
	            - One option could be to either present less dimensions or using something like principle component analyses to present only significant factors that contribute to an individuals decision making                      for headache drugs.
	            - Presenting the most important options, e.g., symptom, price etc may be a better idea. 
	    b. Second are the obvious points – a legend with full details, better labels, and clearer organization of the bubble paths. 
	    c. Perhaps using parallel decision tress instead of a bubble diagram maybe a better idea and would follow a more step-by-step flow.
	    d. I think use of different shapes could also be applied with specific shapes for specific tree components
	    e. Making the diagram interactive may provide a solution where the user can expand to each section that they are interested in and evaluate that path. This would decrease cognitive load by 1. Giving an                initial overview, letting the viewer zoom and filter, and see details on demand. 
	    f. The colours for this chart may be too distracting I think overall it may be better to present either less information, fewer dimensions, or fewer channels. This would allow the information to be more               effectively exhibited and expressed.
